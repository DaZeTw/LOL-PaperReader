    "query": "What is the main idea behind Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs) proposed in the paper?",
    "section": "Abstract – Conceptual Overview",
    "answer": "FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients align with task vectors from finetuned models. Instead of operating in the parameter space, FDAs model the input-representation space, enabling knowledge integration and robustness in model merging.",
    "mysystem_ans": "The main idea behind Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs) is to model the input-representation space rather than the parameter space in order to capture task-specific knowledge for effective model merging. FDAs are synthetic inputs designed to induce gradients that align with task vectors, thereby simulating the role of task vectors in the input space. This approach helps mitigate conflicts in task-specific knowledge and allows for a more flexible and robust merging of models. FDAs can be used independently or in conjunction with existing parameter-centric methods, enhancing their performance in knowledge consolidation and model merging tasks [c1][c2][c4][c5]."

  {
    "query": "How are FDAs constructed according to the proposed framework?",
    "section": "Method – Construction",
    "answer": "FDAs are generated by optimizing a set of synthetic inputs so that their gradients on the pretrained model align with task vectors of downstream checkpoints. This is achieved through gradient-based optimization and a principled initialization scheme, such as weight-based or Gaussian sampling.",
    "mysystem_ans": "FDAs are constructed through a two-stage framework. The first stage involves FDA construction, where synthetic inputs are generated that induce gradients aligning with task vectors. This captures task-specific functional shifts relative to a pretrained model. The second stage focuses on parameter optimization using these FDAs to refine the model further. The framework emphasizes modeling the input-representation space rather than the parameter space, providing a novel approach to model merging [c1][c4][c5]."
  },
  {
    "query": "What is the purpose of the second stage, “parameter optimization using FDAs”?",
    "section": "Method – Optimization Stage",
    "answer": "After constructing FDAs, the pretrained model is optimized on these synthetic inputs to align its outputs with those of finetuned checkpoints. This allows the merged model to capture multi-task knowledge without accessing real task data.",
    "mysystem_ans": "The purpose of the second stage, \"parameter optimization using FDAs,\" is to refine the model parameters by utilizing the gradients induced by the FDAs. This stage aims to enhance the task vectors obtained from previous methods by minimizing a specific objective that adjusts these vectors based on the guidance provided by FDAs. By doing so, the optimization process shifts from the parameter space to the input space, allowing for a more effective integration of task-specific knowledge and improving the model's performance on downstream tasks. This approach helps the model converge towards more favorable regions in the loss landscape, ultimately leading to better outcomes compared to traditional parameter-centric methods [c2][c4][c5]."

  {
    "query": "How did FDAs perform compared to traditional parameter-space model merging methods like Task Arithmetic (TA)?",
    "section": "Experiment – Results",
    "answer": "FDAs significantly outperformed TA and other parameter-centric approaches. For example, FDAs improved ViT-B/16’s average accuracy from 73.94 (TA) to 87.26, and achieved a 15% gain on the GLUE benchmark compared to RoBERTa’s TA baseline.",
    "mysystem_ans": "FDAs outperformed traditional parameter-space model merging methods like Task Arithmetic (TA) in several tasks. For instance, when merging models, the average performance improvement with FDAs was notable across various metrics. Specifically, the results showed that using FDAs with TA led to an average score increase from 0.209 (TA alone) to 0.226 (FDAs with TA using weight initialization) and 0.231 (FDAs with TA using Gaussian initialization) [c3]. This demonstrates that FDAs not only enhance the merging process but also provide a more robust approach to capturing task-specific knowledge compared to traditional methods, which can be sensitive to initialization and may drift from optimal solutions [c4][c5]."

  {
    "query": "Why do the authors argue that modeling the input space can be advantageous compared to the parameter space?",
    "section": "Discussion – Multi-turn Context Test (Q1)",
    "answer": "The input space is more structured and stable, making it easier to capture task-specific variations and avoid parameter conflicts that often arise in merging finetuned models.",
    "mysystem_ans": "The authors argue that modeling the input space can be advantageous compared to the parameter space for several reasons:\n\n1. **Robustness**: FDAs provide greater robustness in model merging, as they consistently guide optimization toward more favorable regions, unlike task vectors that can drift away from optimal solutions due to sensitivity to initialization [c1][c4].\n\n2. **Structured Nature**: The input space is generally more structured than the parameter space, making it easier to model. This structured nature facilitates knowledge transfer and has been empirically validated in various contexts, such as dataset distillation and continual learning [c1][c3].\n\n3. **Alternative Perspective**: By focusing on the input-representation space, FDAs offer a novel perspective on knowledge consolidation. This approach allows for the generation of synthetic inputs that effectively simulate the role of task vectors, thereby capturing task-specific knowledge without directly manipulating parameters [c4][c5].\n\n4. **Performance Improvement**: Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating FDAs into existing parameter-centric methods consistently improves their performance, highlighting the effectiveness of input-space modeling in enhancing model merging outcomes [c3][c5].\n\nOverall, these advantages suggest that input-space modeling can lead to more reliable and effective model merging strategies."

  {
    "query": "Given this reasoning, what other machine learning areas do the authors connect to FDAs’ input-space modeling idea?",
    "section": "Discussion – Multi-turn Context Test (Q2 follow-up)",
    "answer": "They link it to dataset distillation, iterative teaching, and dataset condensation—fields where knowledge is effectively transferred through optimized input samples rather than direct parameter manipulation.",
    "mysystem_ans": "The authors connect FDAs' input-space modeling idea to several machine learning areas, including:\n\n1. **Dataset Distillation**: This area explores how to effectively compress and transfer knowledge from large datasets into smaller, more manageable representations, which aligns with the idea of modeling knowledge in the input space [c1].\n\n2. **Iterative Teaching**: This involves teaching models incrementally, where knowledge transfer can benefit from structured input representations, similar to the principles behind FDAs [c1].\n\n3. **Dataset Condensation**: This approach focuses on creating condensed datasets that retain the essential information of the original data, paralleling the concept of capturing task-specific knowledge through input-space modeling [c1].\n\n4. **Continual Learning**: In this field, models learn from a stream of data over time, requiring effective knowledge integration that can be facilitated by the structured nature of input-space modeling [c1][c2].\n\nBy linking FDAs to these areas, the authors highlight the broader applicability and theoretical foundation of their approach in enhancing knowledge transfer and model merging strategies [c2][c3]."
