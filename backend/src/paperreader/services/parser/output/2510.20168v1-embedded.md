### Abstract

### Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously perform deep reasoning
over multi-hop retrieval and wide -scale information collection—a critical deficiency for real-world
### applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To bridge this gap, we
### introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate agents to integrate
### depth and width in information seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume
### of data, each requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we propose two
methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated collection of 220 questions spanning 15
### diverse domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only
### 2.39% average success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of integrating
### depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore, our error analysis reveals four
failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context
overflow—exposing key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release DeepWideSearch
### to catalyze future research on more capable and robust information-seeking agents.

Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced reason-
ing capabilities [ Achiam et al. , 2023 , Liu et al. , 2024 ,
Guo et al. , 2025 ] have driven substantial progress across
a wide range of natural language tasks. Building on
these advances, LLM-based agents that equipped with
planning, tool use, and multi-step reasoning capabili-
ties [ Xi et al. , 2025 , Gao et al. , 2025 ]—have achieved
strong performance on complex real-world challenges,
including computer operation [ Wang et al. , 2025 ], deep
research [ Du et al. , 2025 ], and information seeking [ Mi-
alon et al. , 2023 , Wei et al. , 2025 ].

5o far, existing benchmarks for evaluating agents
can be systematically categorized along two critical
dimensions (Figure 1 ): search width (measured by the
number of information units to be searched) and search
depth (measured by average search steps for each unit),
revealing four distinct categories: (1) Low width, high
depth benchmarks (e.g., GAIA [ Mialon et al. , 2023 ],

BrowseComp [ Wei et al. , 2025 ]), which focus on intricate deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval for
searching target answers; (2) Low width, low depth benchmarks (e.g., TriviaQA, HotpotQA), which
address simple fact-finding tasks; (3) High width, low depth benchmarks (e.g., WideSearch [ Wong
et al. , 2025 ] and PaSa [ He et al. , 2025 ]), which emphasize broad information collection about specific
questions; and critically, (4) High width, high depth tasks, which collect extensive information that
required deep reasoning—a critical capability for real-world applications like comprehensive market
analysis and business development but entirely unaddressed by current benchmarks. For instance,
as shown in Figure 2 , the case “identifying the Top-10 EV maker in China by MoM sales growth (Aug
2025) and its Top-3 best-selling new EV cars (price and range)” exemplifies this challenge. It requires
agent to gather a large volume of candidates, i.e. , EV makers , to fill the result table through wide-scale
search, and verify each candidate by performing deep reasoning, a combinatorial complexity that
exceeds both the scope of width-focused evaluations and the scale of depth-focused benchmarks.

To address this critical evaluation gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the capability of agents in deep and wide information seeking. Since it
is challenging to construct deep and wide search instances even with human annotation, we develop
two methods for conversing established datasets: (1) Deep2Wide Conversion , which extends deep
search benchmarks (e.g., GAIA and BrowseComp) by augmenting their information scope through
human-annotated table schemas; and (2) Wide2Deep Conversion , which enhances wide search queries
by replacing explicit entities with synthesized complex sub-questions that necessitate multi-hop
search steps. Both approaches integrate rigorous human validation protocols to ensure data quality
while maintaining the combinatorial complexity inherent in real-world information-seeking scenarios.
The final benchmark comprises 220 meticulously curated questions spanning 15 diverse domains,
featuring both Chinese and English queries with human-verified ground truths, with 85 instances
derived from Deep2Wide and 135 from Wide2Deep construction methods.

We conduct comprehensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs and agent systems on Deep-
WideSearch. Our results demonstrate that even the most advanced agent systems achieve only
2.39% average success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial difficulty of this kind of
information seeking task. Notably, while agent frameworks consistently improve core entity iden-
tification (e.g., +15.91 absolute percentage points in Core Entity Accuracy), they exhibit limited
efficacy in wide-scale information collection, frequently underperforming their LLMs counterparts
using internal knowledge. Through systematic error analysis, we identify four fundamental failure

modes: (1) lack of effective reflection mechanisms when encountering problematic search trajectories;
(2) overreliance on parametric internal knowledge leading to outdated or inaccurate information;
(3) insufficient retrieval despite accessing relevant webpages; and (4) context overflow exceeding
current agent architectue limitations. These empirical findings expose key limitations of current agent
architecture for the deep and wide information-seeking task. To facilitate further research in this
critical domain, we have publicly released the DeepWideSearch benchmark, including datasets and
evaluation codebase.

### 2. Related Work

### 2.1. LLM-based Search Agents

The emergence of LLM-based agent systems has enabled sophisticated information-seeking capabilities,
with frameworks ranging from closed-source implementations (e.g., OpenAI Deep Research) to open-
source platforms (e.g., WebAgent [ Wu et al. , 2025b ] and Cognitive Kernel-Pro [ Fang et al. , 2025b ]).
These systems have demonstrated proficiency in numerous application domains, including computer-
use agents, deep research for complex problem investigation [ Han et al. , 2025 ], and multi-step
information retrieval through tool use [ Xi et al. , 2025 ]. Among these applications, information-
seeking agents represent a critical frontier impact real-world utility. Current research in this domain
primarily addresses five technical challenges: (1) agentic system architecture design [ Zhang et al. ,
2025a , Zhou et al. , 2025a , Xia et al. , 2025 , Fang et al. , 2025a ], (2) synthetic data generation for
complex scenarios [ Wu et al. , 2025a , Li et al. , 2025 , Tao et al. , 2025 ], (3) optimization techniques
for retrieval efficiency [ Zhang et al. , 2025b , Fan et al. , 2025 , Sun et al. , 2025 ], (4) knowledge
management for multi-hop reasoning [ Zhang et al. , 2025a , Xu et al. , 2025 ], and (5) evaluation
methodologies for performance assessment [ Zhuge et al. , 2025 , Gou et al. , 2025 ].

### 2.2. Benchmarks for LLM-based Agents

Existing evaluation frameworks for information-seeking agents primarily target two distinct capabil-
ities: (1) Depth in multi-hop reasoning, measured by benchmarks like GAIA [ Mialon et al. , 2023 ]
and BrowseComp [ Wei et al. , 2025 ] for general complex reasoning, and domain-specific variants in
healthcare [ Chen et al. , 2025 ] and E-commerce [ Lyu et al. , 2025 ]; (2) Width in information collection,
assessed by WideSearch [ Wong et al. , 2025 ] for comprehensive retrieval of atomic information, and
PaSa [ He et al. , 2025 ] and SPAR [ Shi et al. , 2025 ] for academic literature retrieval. Crucially, no
existing benchmark captures the combinatorial complexity inherent in real-world information-seeking
tasks that simultaneously demand extensive exploration (width) and intricate multi-step reasoning
(depth). This fundamental gap in evaluation methodology has prevented meaningful progress toward
agents capable of handling the complex real-world information-seeking. To address this limitation,
we propose DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the capability of
agents in the deep and wide information-seeking task.

### 3. Task Formulation

As shown in Figure 3 , DeepWideSearch establishes an evaluation framework that explicitly captures
the combinatorial complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks—requiring agents to perform
deep reasoning and wide -scale information collection. The evaluation metrics (Column F1, Row F1,
Item F1, and Success Rate) illustrated in Figure 3 will be formally described in Section 4.4 .

### 4. Methodology of Dataset Construction

Constructing DeepWideSearch instances from scratch presents significant challenges due to the
substantial human effort. To address this challenge while maintaining methodological rigor, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets into deep and wide search questions: (1)
Deep2Wide Conversion and (2) Wide2Deep Conversion. Both methodologies are complemented by
human annotation procedures to ensure the quality.

### 4.1. Convert Deep Search Datasets (Deep2Wide)

Existing deep search benchmarks such as GAIA [ Mialon et al. , 2023 ], BrowseComp [ Wei et al. , 2025 ]
and BrowseComp-zh [ Zhou et al. , 2025b ] require agents to employ multi-hop web browsing and
deep reasoning to identify target answers. Building upon these resources, we develop the Deep2Wide
conversion methodology by expanding the scope of searched information. As illustrated in Figure 4
(Top), our approach follows a three-stage pipeline inspired by WideSearch [ Wong et al. , 2025 ]:
(1) Core Entity Filtering : We sample 80 Chinese questions from BrowseComp-zh and 20 English
questions from BrowseComp, filtering out instances where answers are unsuitable as core entities ( e.g. ,
dates and numerical values). For example, as shown in Figure 5 , Dan Lin is the core entity of the deep
search question; (2) Table Schema Definition : Human annotators design structured table schemas
by defining relevant information about the core entities; (3) Comprehensive Annotation : Annotators

perform exhaustive web searches to populate the tables. Each instance requires approximately 30
minutes of human annotation time, ensuring high-quality and verified data. Following a design
similar to that of the WideSearch benchmark [ Wong et al. , 2025 ], we incorporated timestamps into
each question to ensure that the answers remain invariant over time.

### Deep Search Question : There is a Chinese athlete who has achieved remarkable success in a
ball sport. He was the first player in his discipline to successfully defend his title at a major
competition and has won multiple world championship titles. His sport underwent rule changes
in the early 21st century, and he became the first men’s singles Olympic champion under the
new rules.
### Core Entity : Dan Lin.
### Table Schema : Competition records of Dan Lin from 2010 to 2020 including the following
columns: Date, Tournament Name, Level, Event, Result, and Match Details (including opponent,
score, and win/loss outcome).

Figure 5 | One deep search question in BrowseComp-ZH.

### 4.2. Convert Wide Search Datasets (Wide2Deep)

Given that WideSearch [ Wong et al. , 2025 ] represents the publicly available dataset providing human-
annotated tabular answers for wide-scale information-seeking, we develop the Wide2Deep conversion
methodology to transform these wide search queries by introducing complexity in entity identification.
This approach reuse the valuable human-annotated table in WideSearch while enhancing the deep
reasoning requirements. Inspired by WebWalker [ Wu et al. , 2025b ], we implement a human-in-the-
loop pipeline (Figure 3, bottom) comprising five stages: (1) Entity Extraction : Advanced LLMs
identify core entities in 160 English and Chinese WideSearch questions, similar to the core entity in
the deep search benchmark (Figure 5 ); (2) Deep Sub-Question Synthesis : Following prior work [ Li
et al. , 2025 , Tao et al. , 2025 ], a web search agent are implemented to recursively traverse official
websites about core entities and collecting their rich entity information. Then, a complex sub-question
is generated based on these rich information, adhering to two critical constraints: (a) Uniqueness: The
answer to the question must be a single, well-defined entity; (b) Complexity: Direct derivation of the

5

## Page 6

DeepWideSearch: Benchmarking Depth and Width in Agentic Information Seeking

entity from the question must require at least one additional web search step; (3) Question Fusion :
Claude-sonnet-4 fuses the deep sub-question with the original wide search query; and (4) Human
Annotation : A team of seven master’s-level annotators validates and refines the synthesized questions
to ensure uniqueness, complexity, and linguistic naturalness. This process requires approximately 40
minutes of human annotation per instance, maintaining the high-quality standards essential for a
rigorous benchmark. The prompts of core entity extraction, deep sub-question synthesis and question
fusion are placed at Appendix C .

### 4.3. Data Statistics

Table 1 provides a comprehensive comparison of our DeepWideSearch benchmark against exist-
ing datasets across multiple dimensions. Our benchmark demonstrates significantly higher search
complexity compared to prior work, with an average table volume of 414.10 information units, sub-
stantially exceeding deep search benchmarks like GAIA and BrowseComp. Crucially, DeepWideSearch
requires 4.21 average search steps to identify core entities—nearly 4 × more complex than WideSearch
(1.24). The dataset spans 15 diverse domains, covering both English and Chinese queries, with 220
carefully curated instances (85 from Deep2Wide, 135 from Wide2Deep). These statistics empirically
validate the deep and wide attributes of our proposed DeepWideSearch. Cases and more details about
the data in Table 1 can be found in Appendix A .

### 4.4. Evaluation Metrics of DeepWideSearch

As shown in Figure 3 , we evaluate agent performance on DeepWideSearch along three complementary
axes: Depth, Width, and Efficiency.

### Depth Evaluation
The depth dimension evaluate the capability of agents to correctly identify target
entities through deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval. Following previous works [ Wei et al. , 2025 ,
Mialon et al. , 2023 ], we introduce the Column-F1 metric. As shown in Figure 3 , Column-F1 is
computed as the F1 score over the unique columns in the table. These unique columns correspond to
the core attributes of entities ( i.e. , rows) that uniquely identify them. Therefore, Column-F1 can be
seen as the extension of the accuracy used in established deep search benchmarks, computing the
precision of a group of entities (rows in the table). Higher Column-F1 scores indicate more precise
entities identification across the entire table structure. Moreover, since our proposed two methods
include the core entity of questions, we also introduce the Core Entity Accuracy (CE Acc.) , serving
as an additional indicator of deep reasoning capability.

## Page 7

DeepWideSearch: Benchmarking Depth and Width in Agentic Information Seeking

### Width Evaluation
The width dimension measures how comprehensively and accurately the agent
retrieves all associated information units for entities (rows in the table). Building upon the evaluation
framework of WideSearch [ Wong et al. , 2025 ], we assess performance at three granularities: (1)
### Success Rate : A binary metric indicating whether the agent’s output table exactly matches the
human-annotated ground truth (all rows, columns, and values identical); (2) Row-level F1 : Computes
precision, recall, and F1 scores at the row level (i.e., for each entity and its associated attributes),
capturing whether the agent retrieves complete contextual information per entity; (3) Item-level
F1 : The finest-grained metric evaluating accuracy at the individual cell level, reflecting fidelity in
retrieving atomic information units within the structured table.

### Efficiency Evaluation
To address the substantial computational costs inherent in web-scale tool
usage (including search, browsing APIs), we further evaluate system efficiency through two metrics:
(1) Input/Output Token : The total tokens consumed during reasoning and tool calls; (2) Cost :
Estimated cost expenditure based on standard model inference API pricing during query resolution.
These efficiency metrics are critical for real-world deployment considerations, particularly given the
demanding requirements for extensive multi-round search and browsing.

To account for stochasticity in LLM-based agent behavior, we conduct four independent runs per
question for each baseline system. For both depth and width metrics, we report three complementary
statistics: (1) Avg@4 : The mean performance across all four runs; (2) Max@4 : The best performance
observed across the four runs; and (3) Pass@4 : The proportion of questions solved successfully in at
least one run (only for Success Rate). This comprehensive evaluation protocol ensures robustness
against sampling variance while also highlighting the system’s peak performance potential.

### 5. Experiments

### 5.1. Experimental Setup

We evaluate three kinds of baselines on our proposed DeepWideBenchmark: (1) Closed-source LLMs
(without tool calls) : OpenAI o3-mini, GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen-Max;
(2) Open-source LLMs (without tool calls) : DeepSeek-V3/R1 [ Guo et al. , 2025 , Liu et al. , 2024 ],
KIMI-K2 [ Team et al. , 2025 ], Qwen3 series [ Yang et al. , 2025 ]; and (3) Open-source Agent Systems :
WebSailor [ Li et al. , 2025 ], Smolagents [ Roucher et al. , 2025 ] and OWL [ Hu et al. , 2025 ] are equipped
with advanced GPT-5, Claude-sonnet-4 and Gemini-2.5-Pro backbone models. All agent systems
utilized identical tools: (1) Google Search API; and (2) Webpage Visit tool. Since webpages in HTML
format are often very lengthy, we use the same LLM in the agents to summarize the HTML into a
concise summarization. The cost of this summarization process is also counted into the efficiency
metrics. We utilized the official API endpoints of these LLMs with their default decoding parameter
settings.

### 5.2. Main Results

The complete results are presented in Table 2 . It can be found that most baselines demonstrate
near-zero success rates, with only WebSailor (Gemini 2.5 Pro) and WebSailor (Claude Sonnet 4)
exceeding 1-2% in Success Rate (Avg@4), confirming the inherent complexity of simultaneously
handling deep reasoning and wide-scale information collection. Notably, Gemini 2.5 Pro emerges as
the top-performing LLM, achieving the highest Column F1 (45.27%, Avg@4), Core Entity Accuracy
(73.98%, Avg@4), and Pass@4 Success Rate (1.82%), even outperforming several agent systems.
This exceptional performance indicates that Gemini 2.5 Pro possesses advanced reasoning capabilities

for entity identification and extensive internal knowledge for filling result tables without external
search. Furthermore, we detail the performance of baselines from depth and width metrics as below.

### Depth Metrics
Our analysis reveals that agent systems generally enhance the deep search capabilities
of base LLMs, as evidenced by consistent improvements in Core Entity Accuracy (CE Acc.). For example,
the CE Acc. (Avg@4) of GPT-5 increases from 58.41% (base LLM) to 74.32% when integrated into
WebSailor, representing a +15.91 percentage point gain. Similarly, Claude Sonnet 4 improves from
57.95% to 70.91% under WebSailor, demonstrating the effectiveness of iterative tool calls and multi-
step reasoning in complex information retrieval. However, Gemini 2.5 Pro represents a notable
exception to this trend. Upon close inspection of generated outputs, we find that Gemini 2.5 Pro in
agent systems frequently fails due to three critical issues: (a) producing invalid markdown-formatted
tables; (b) executing incorrect tool call APIs; and (c) incomplete task solving due to inference errors,
occurring in 24.24% of cases on average—substantially higher than GPT-5 (16.36%) and Claude
Sonnet 4 (17.80%). This suggests that Gemini 2.5 Pro’s output formatting behavior becomes brittle
when subjected to multi-step tool orchestration. Critically, while agent systems improve core entity
identification, they fail to consistently enhance column-level precision. For instance, the Column F1
(Avg@4) of Claude Sonnet 4 model declines from 32.63% (base LLM) to 30.08% in OWL and 21.60%
in Smolagents. This pattern highlights a fundamental limitation: even when agents successfully
identify core entities through multi-hop reasoning, current agent architectures cannot reliably collect
complete entities, with their effectiveness often falling below the usage of internal knowledge in base
LLMs.

### Width Metrics
When evaluating width metrics that measure comprehensive information collection,
we observe that most agent frameworks do not significantly improve the base LLMs’ wide search
capabilities. Only three combinations demonstrate consistent improvements across all width metrics:

## Page 9

DeepWideSearch: Benchmarking Depth and Width in Agentic Information Seeking

OWL (Claude Sonnet 4), WebSailor (Claude Sonnet 4), and WebSailor (GPT-5). The remaining agents
show substantial performance degradation compared to their counterpart base LLMs. Beyond the
issues specific to Gemini 2.5 Pro that described above, the Smolagents framework also consistently
underperforms across nearly all metrics. Our investigation reveals that Smolagents employs minimal
reasoning before tool calls, which restricts the effectiveness of subsequent tool calls. This architectural
constraint prevents Smolagents from formulating precise search queries, resulting in inadequate
information coverage and poor performance on width metrics.

### 6. Analysis

In this section, we conduct several detailed analysis on Efficiency (Section 6.1 ), Tool Calls (Section 6.2 ),
Differences in Dataset Construction Methods (Section 6.3 ), Per-topic Performance (Section 6.4 ), and
Error Analysis (Section 6.5 ).

Compared to deep search or wide search, Deep-
WideSearch imposes significantly higher com-
putational and operational overhead. As shown
in Table 3 , even state-of-the-art agents incur sub-
stantial resource costs per query. For instance,
OWL (GPT-5) and WebSailor (Claude Sonnet 4)
achieve average $2.75 and $1.40 per question
— with many queries remaining unresolved de-
spite this high cost. Due to unstable network
conditions and tool call errors, agents often re-
quire multiple retry attempts to complete tasks
such as search, significantly increasing computational overhead—for instance, OWL (GPT-5) incurs
an average cost exceeding $6.8 under retry conditions. These results underscore a critical inefficiency
in current agent architectures when tackling complex deep and wide information seeking tasks. This
suggests that existing systems are not yet scalable for real-world deployment of DeepWideSearch,
motivating future work on efficient planning, memory reuse, and adaptive resource allocation.

Table 4 shows the average number of tool calls (Search and

WebSailor. Notably, WebSailor (Claude Sonnet 4) exhibits
a significantly higher Search tool calls (23.23) compared
to Gemini 2.5 Pro (4.77) and GPT-5 (8.72). This aligns
with its superior performance (Table 2 ), suggesting that
scaling the search tool calls improves the performance.

### 6.3. Differences in Dataset Construction Methods

Table 5 demonstrates the average performance of advanced LLMs (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4 and Gemini
2.5 Pro) with their counterpart agent systems. It can be found that the Deep2Wide construction
method produces substantially more challenging data than Wide2Deep method. For example, LLMs
and agents achieves nearly 0.0% success rate on Deep2Wide (Avg. LLMs: 0.0% Avg@4; Avg. Agents:

Critically, the overall Entity Accuracy on Deep2Wide is only 33.29% (vs. 88.84% on Wide2Deep).
This observation indicates that the synthesized deep sub-question in the Wide2Deep method is easier
for LLMs to solve. Nevertheless, the column-F1 of Wide2Deep remains below 51%, indicating that
comprehensively collecting entities is still challenging.

### 6.4. Per-topic Performance Analysis

As shown in Figure 6 , we analyze topic-wise performance through bidirectional bar charts evaluating
depth metrics (Column-F1, CE Acc.) and width metrics (Item-F1, Row-F1), excluding domains with
fewer than 5 samples. Four key patterns emerge: (1) The top-5 most frequent topics (sample count
>20) are Film & Movies , Politics , Finance , Technology , and Sports ; (2) Politics achieves the highest
item- and row-level F1 scores (35% and 19%), indicating wide search are more tractable in this topic,
while Politics and Finance attain the highest column F1 and CE accuracy, suggesting deep search are
comparatively easier here; (3) Despite strong depth performance in Finance , Travel , and Education
topics, the performance of baselines exhibit substantially lower width metrics on these three topics
(e.g., Travel 20% item F1 and Finance 8% row F1), revealing that strong deep search capability does
not guarantee effective wide search capability; and (4) History and Games consistently underperform
across all metrics ( e.g. , 5% Column-F1 of History ), establishing them as the most challenging topics.
These findings highlight the heterogeneous nature of search complexity across topics.

### 6.5. Error Analysis

As shown in Tables 2 , agent systems might underperform backbone LLMs on DeepWideSearch tasks.
Our error analysis reveals four key failure patterns: (1) Lack of Reflection: agents often lack
effective reflection mechanisms. When encountering wrong trajectories (Figures 13 ) or tool call errors
(Figure 14 ), they prematurely conclude the task is unsolvable and output empty tables rather than
analyzing failure causes and exploring alternative paths; (2) Overreliance on Internal Knowledge:
agents frequently overrely on internal knowledge. Even when correctly identifying core entities
(Figure 15 ), they often generate tables solely using their internal parametric knowledge rather than
performing proper web queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate information due to limited training
data scope; (3) Insufficient Retrieval: information retrieval is often insufficient. For example, despite

identifying relevant pages (Figure 17 ), agents frequently fail to properly access complete context
through visit operations, leading to significant information omissions. Even when visit operations are
executed correctly, summarized webpage data may still miss critical details. This limitation motivates
the design of a question-aware, customized webpage summarization process in agent systems; and (4)
### Context Overflow: context overflow presents a fundamental challenge. Deep wide search requires
extensive multi-step reasoning and numerous search tool calls, significantly expanding context length
(Figure 16 ). This issue occurred in 24.96% of cases, exceeding the context management capabilities of
current agent architectures; In summary, these four error patterns highlight that current agents face
substantial limitations when addressing the challenges of depth and width in complex information-
seeking tasks. Addressing these limitations requires specialized architecture for deep wide search
scenarios.

### 7. Conclusion

This paper addresses the critical gap in information-seeking agent evaluation by introducing Deep-
WideSearch benchmark, the first benchmark designed to simultaneously assess deep reasoning and
wide-scale information collection. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art agents achieve
only 2.39% average success rate on this challenging benchmark, revealing fundamental limitations
for current agents. These results underscore the combinatorial complexity of deep and wide search
as a key frontier to guide future research toward more capable information-seeking agents.

### 8. Limitations and Future Work

Despite our established DeepWideSearch benchmark, there are three key limitations remain to
be addressed in the future work: (1) As shown in Table 5 , the Wide2Deep construction method
produces significantly easier questions than Deep2Wide, as evidenced by the substantially higher CE
Accuracy. We will iteratively refine sub-questions to increase question complexity while maintaining
natural language quality; (2) Our current dataset exhibits slight differences with real-world deep
and wide search questions in terms of solution paths (Cases in Appendix B ). In future work, we
will iteratively refine the DeepWideSearch dataset to better align with real-world applications; and
(3) Our dataset construction relies heavily on human annotation, limiting scalability. Future work
should explore automated data generation techniques and develop reference-free evaluation metrics
that avoid complex, human-verified tabular answers, enabling efficient dataset expansion and model
optimization across diverse domains.

DeepWideSearch: Benchmarking Depth and Width in Agentic Information Seeking

### A. Details of Datasets

The table volume in Table 1 represents the number of the searched information in the DeepWideSearch
questions, which is defined as the product of rows and columns of the table. The average steps of
the search entities is counted as the number of the reasoning steps and tool calls. Specifically, the
average steps of GAIA is counted by the reference trajectories in the dataset, and the average steps
of WideSearch is annotated by our three human raters. Besides, Figure 7 and Figure 8 present two
cases in our proposed DeepWideSearch dataset.

Case Deep2Wide_62 Instance (Core Entity is Nobel Proze)

### B. Differences between Our Dataset and Real-world Questions

Two Deep and Wide Questions

### Our DeepWideSearch Question : Identify an artist who studied at both the Central Academy
of Fine Arts in China and the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in Germany, and who pursued further
studies in Germany. During his time in Germany, he studied under three renowned artists, one
of whom held the record for the highest auction price ever achieved by a living artist in 2012.
Gather information about this artist’s solo exhibitions, including exhibition title, venue, city,
and exhibition dates.
### Solution Path : first identify the artist ( deep/wide search ), then perform wide search for
information collection ( wide search ).

### Real-world Deep and Wide Question : Please help me identify emerging local merchants
from Thailand and Vietnam that operate pet supplies categories on e-commerce platforms such
as Lazada and Shopee, and whose store GMV growth rate exceeded 50% in the first half of
2025. (Emerging merchants are defined as those that opened their stores after 2023.) I need
the following information for each qualifying store: store URL, company legal entity details,
business contact email, and the founder’s LinkedIn profile.
### Solution Path : first perform wide search to list candidate stores ( wide search ), then perform
deep search to collect their information (GMV) for verification ( deep search ).

Figure 9 | Two cases of the deep and wide search questions.

Figure 9 illustrates two representative deep and wide search questions: the first is an example from
our constructed DeepWideSearch dataset, and the second is drawn from a real-world e-commerce
scenario. While our dataset captures the essential characteristics of deep and wide search, the primary
difference from real-world settings lies in the solution path. In our dataset, the process emphasizes
first performing a deep search to gather critical information, followed by a wide search to expand
relevant attributes. In contrast, real-world tasks often begin with a wide search to collect a large
pool of candidates, followed by a deep search over each candidate for verification. Nevertheless, it is
important to emphasize that despite this procedural difference, our dataset still exhibits the traits of
deep and wide search. Specifically, during the initial deep search phase, the model also need to list
and reason over a set of candidates, systematically applying deep verification to determine which
candidates satisfy the problem constraints and thereby identify the correct target entity. Consequently,
even this first-stage deep search inherently incorporates the characteristic of the wide search.

### C. Prompts for DeepWideSearch Data Construction

This section presents three prompts for Wide2Deep method: (1) Core Entity Extraction Prompt in
Figure 10 ; (2) Deep Sub-Question Synthesis Prompt in Figure 11 ; (3) Question Fusion in Figure 12 .

### # You are a professional entity extraction expert tasked with identifying the most critical entity
### from a given text query.

### # Classification Requirements:
- The entity must be a specific, concrete entity object mentioned within the text query.
- A query may contain multiple entities, but prioritize outputting the single most central entity. If no
single core entity can be determined, output multiple entities.
- Output ONLY JSON-formatted data containing the entities, with no additional content, explanations,
or numbering (to ensure direct parseability). Please directly output the entity, without any explanation.
### # Reference Few-shot Examples
* Input:
I absolutely love Jay Chou. Please find all songs released by Jay Chou between January 2004 and
September 2010 (including January 2004 and September 2010). Include song details: title, lyricist,
composer, release date, album, and duration.
Notes:
1. I want only Jay Chou’s original vocals (collaborations allowed), excluding instrumental tracks.
2. Format release dates as yyyy/mm/dd; duration as x minutes x seconds (e.g., 3 minutes 5 seconds).
3. Include only songs released in China.
4. Exclude live versions and demos.
5.
Include only songs from Jay Chou’s studio albums (exclude singles, single albums, film/TV
soundtracks, EPs).
* Output: Jay Chou

* Input:
I want to register for the 2026 postgraduate entrance exam. Please check the (retest) for the Journalism
and Communication program (full-time professional master’s) at Chinese universities in Region A with
211 Project status or higher for 2025 (total score only).
* Output: Journalism and Communication program

* Input:
Using statistics from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), list the specific
military expenditures (in billion USD without decimals, e.g., 9000 billion USD), GDP (in trillion USD to
two decimal places, e.g., 30.21 trillion USD), global military expenditure ranking, head of state (actual
leader), and defense minister for the US, Russia, Germany, India, and Japan for each year from 2019 to
2024 (inclusive).
* Output: Stockholm

* Input:
I’m running out of books to read. Could you compile a ranked list of the top 10 books from Douban
Reading’s annual (overall) for 2022-2024 (inclusive), plus the top 10 bestsellers and highest-rated
books from Dangdang.com each year? Include authors’ names.
* Output: Douban Reading, Dangdang.com

* Input:
Please compile a table listing the "CNN Hero of the Year" for every year the award was actually
presented, from its first introduction through 2024 (including 2024), along with relevant details for
each honoree.
* Output: CNN Hero of the Year

DeepWideSearch: Benchmarking Depth and Width in Agentic Information Seeking

Please help me gather all available information about “{entity}”, and based on the collected information,
synthesize a multi-hop query that meets the following requirements:
(1) The answer to the query must be exactly “{entity}” only—no other answers or ambiguities allowed;
(2) The information about “{entity}” included in the query should not be overly specific (e.g., exact
dates, locations, awards, or distinctive features), so that one cannot directly find “entity” by searching
those fragments online;
(3) A human answering the query must perform multiple search steps and gather information from at
least three distinct, non-repeating URLs to logically infer “{entity}”;
(4) The query must be concise. Avoid constructing long queries by piling up excessive features. Include
only 2–3 pieces of information about {entity}. Focus on the ambiguity and reliability of these features,
rather than the quantity;
(5) Consider temporal validity—the answer to the query must remain stable over time and not change
with time;
(6) After generating the query, you must conduct an additional verification process via search engines:
extract 3–5 simplified search queries from the synthesized query (each reflecting one key feature or
phrase from the original query; keep them short and focused on core keywords). Analyze the search
results to ensure that “{entity}” cannot be directly found in a single step. If “{entity}” can be found
### directly through any of these 3–5 searches, the synthesized query is too simple and does not
### meet requirements—please repeat the entire process until none of the derived searches can
### directly reveal “{entity}”.

### # Output Format: Place all generated query, reference URLs, and reasoning in the stan-
### dard JSON structure

### D. Error Cases in DeepWideSearch

This section provides the four kinds of representative errors of agents: (1) Lack of Reflection (Figure 13
and Figure 14 ); (2) Overreliance on Internal Knowledge (Figure 15 ); (3) Context Overflow (Figure 16 );
and (4) Insufficient Retrieval (Figure 17 ).

You are a senior question synthesis expert responsible for integrating a complex question about an
entity into an original query containing that entity, thereby constructing a more challenging composite
query. Please strictly follow the rules below:
1. Task Objective :
- Replace the entity in the original query with the corresponding complex question.
- The generated query must require users to first resolve the complex question to obtain the entity
information, then proceed with the information retrieval steps in the original query.
- The final synthesized query must be grammatically correct and logically coherent.
- The complex question is in Chinese, but the original query may be in either Chinese or English: if
the original query is in English, you must translate the complex question into accurate and equivalent
English and integrate it into the query (without adding or omitting any information from the original
Chinese question, ensuring full translation fidelity); if the original query is in Chinese, the final
synthesized query must also be in Chinese.

2. Input Specifications :
- Original query (query): {query}
- Entity (entities): entities (for internal reference only; must not appear in the output )
- Complex question (question): A complex query question to find entities: question

3. Synthesis Rules :
- Replace the entity in the original query with the descriptive text of the complex question.
- The complex question must be transformed into a noun phrase (remove the question mark and
rephrase it as a descriptive clause).
- Do not reveal any entity information (specific names from “entities” must not appear).
- Maintain professional translation quality and avoid awkward or unnatural phrasing.
