While\nprior work have explored providing overview structure of multiple\ndocuments based on citations [ 16 , 80 ], semantic similarity [ 36 , 85 ],\nor human computation [ 14 , 31 , 62 ], they could still lead to com-\nplex structures that are hard to interpret [ 35 ] or require significant\ncrowdsourcing efforts. Relatedly sidesteps these issues by reusing\nexisting related work paragraphs in published papers which already\ncite sets of related references with descriptions connecting them\n[ 73 ]. As an example, consider a scholar trying to better understand\nthe space of online misinformation . With online misinformation as\nthe query term, Relatedly shows the reader a list of paragraphs\nthat describe and cite multiple relevant prior work.

For this, Relatedly provides reading and cross-referencing\nsupport by keeping track of paragraphs and references explored by\nthe readers.

    "text": "A range of disabilities cause people to read scientific documents\nusing a wide variety of devices and reading tools. For example,\nblind and low vision readers may use assistive reading technology\nsuch as screen readers, screen magnification, or text-to-speech to\nread documents [ 90 ]. Furthermore, people without disabilities face\nsituational impairments, such as the inability to view a screen while\ndriving or may have a preference for consuming content on a small,\nmobile device.\nMany of these reading tools, such as screen readers, do not\nfunction properly on document formats designed for print such as\nPDF unless the document has been manually post-processed to add\ninformation about reading order, content type, etc., which is rarely\nperformed on scientific documents [ 6 , 98 ]. Further, certain content\nelements such as figures require the addition of alternative text in\norder to be read aloud at all (figure captions typically assume the\nreader can see the figure and do not provide the same semantic\ncontent as alt text). High magnification reduces the viewport (the\namount of visible content) and can dramatically increase the amount\nof scrolling and panning required, especially for mu",

Visual\nscanning for information may be impacted or unavailable in these\nsettings, making it more difficult to find and navigate between\ncontent in the document [75].\nOne way to render legacy PDF content more accessibly is to parse\nand convert it into a more flexible format, such as XML or HTML,\nwhich can then be formatted for mobile devices and augmented\nfor reading by screen readers. The SciA11y system 6 demonstrates\nthis approach, automatically converting 12M academic PDFs to\nHTML [ 97 ]; a user study with blind and low vision participants\ndemonstrated strong user appreciation of the output, though some\nerrors remain (e.g., failing in certain cases to distinguish footnotes\nfrom body text, difficulty parsing math equations) [ 98 ].
