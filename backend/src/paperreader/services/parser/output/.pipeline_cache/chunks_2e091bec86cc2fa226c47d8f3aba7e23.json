Academic search engines, such as Google Scholar and\nSemantic Scholar help scholars discover research papers. Auto-\nmated summarization for research papers [ 11 ] helps scholars triage\nbetween research papers. But when it comes to actually reading\nresearch papers, the process, based on a static PDF format, has\nremained largely unchanged for many decades. This is a problem\nbecause digesting technical research papers is difficult [2, 5].\nIn contrast, interactive and personalized documents have seen\nsignificant adoption in domains outside of academic research. For\nexample, news websites such as the New York Times often present\ninteractive articles with explorable visualizations that allow read-\ners to understand complex data in a personalized way.

This behavior,\nsometimes referred to as forward/backward chaining or footnote\nchasing , is ubiquitous and has been observed across many schol-\narly disciplines [ 74 ]. Supporting this, one popular feature in the\nSemantic Reader 1 is in-situ Paper Cards that pop up when readers\nclick on an inline citation, dramatically reducing the interaction\ncost caused by jumping back-and-forth between inline citations\nand their corresponding references at the end of a research paper\n(Figure 1).

Scholars often read papers non-linearly; they might return\nto a previously-read passage to recall some information, or jump\nforward to a different section of the paper (or to another paper) to\nsatisfy an information need before jumping back. While jumping\ncan help scholars orient their reading to sections of interest, it\ncan also be a distraction by causing readers to constantly switch\ncontexts. Non-linear navigation can be especially burdensome when\nthe reader is interested in a particular type of information (e.g.,\nskimming a paper for the main results), but doesn’t know precisely\nwhere to find it within the paper. In this section we discuss two\nsystems, Scim [ 28 ] and Ocean [ 75 ], which demonstrate different\napproaches to helping readers navigate efficiently through a paper\ntoward high-value, relevant information.",

The Semantic Reader\nProject presents an opportunity for further AI research in scholarly\ndocument processing, especially when paired with human-centered\nresearch grounded in user-validated systems and scenarios. The\nbar for deploying AI models to support real-world reading is high;\nwe often found during iterative design and usability studies that\neven slight errors in these models can have detrimental effects on\nthe readers. Until recently, interface design could require months\nof development of bespoke AI models which creates a barrier for\nquickly iterate different system designs. Recent advancements in\nscaling large language models (LLMs) has altered this landscape\nby enabling researchers to experiment with a wide range of new\nNLP capabilities at relatively low cost [ 10 ]. This has the potential of\nsignificantly lowering the cost of human-centered AI design by in-\ncorporating user feedback in earlier stages of system development\nto create AI systems that work in symphony with the users beyond\npure automation [ 87 ].

In other cases, authors might not have the\nrequisite expertise (e.g., they may not have a good sense of reader\nneeds or what non-experts are confused by) or may have the wrong\nincentives. Future work should consider author perspectives on\nthese augmented experiences. A related issue is around systems for\nmore efficient reading or synthesis, which may encourage readers\nto take shortcuts that lead to incorrect understanding, sloppy re-\nsearch, or even outright plagiarism. Instead of simply seeking to\nincrease reading throughput uniformly, our systems should enable\ntriage , so that readers can dedicate time for thoughtful and careful\nreading when the content is important.
