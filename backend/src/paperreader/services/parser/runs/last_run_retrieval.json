As of June 30, 2025, among 1.8 million models, only Figure 4 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the WCC distribution. We observe (i) the largest WCC covers 247,244 nodes, accounting for 61.4% of all the nodes. It reflects the dense interconnections that pervade the ecosystem. This vital element is essential for effective information sharing, resource allocation, and structural support, and is the base of the ecosystem. In the largest WCC, major models are included, such as Gemma-2B , DistilBERT , and GPT-2 . (ii) In contrast, the remaining WCCs collectively hold 38.6% of the nodes, with most having 1, 2, or 3 nodes. This indicates a fragmented outer edge characterized by specialized models, rare 4",
