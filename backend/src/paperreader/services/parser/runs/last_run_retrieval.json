These resources to-\ngether open-source software, 3,4 AI models [ 11 , 20 , 42 , 86 ], and open\ndatasets [50, 61] to support continued work in this area.\nIn this paper, we focus on summarizing our efforts under the\nresearch pillar of the Semantic Reader Project. We structure our\ndiscussion around five broad challenges faced by readers of research\npapers:\n• Discovery: Following paper citations is one of the main\nstrategies that scholars employ to discover additional rel-\nevant papers, but keeping track of the large numbers of\ncitations can be overwhelming. In §2, we explore ways to\nvisually augment research papers to help readers prioritize\ntheir paper exploration during literature reviews.\n1 Semantic Reader: https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/semantic-reader\n2 Available for over 369K papers as of February 2023.\n3 For UI development: https://github.com/allenai/pdf-component-library\n4 For processing PDFs: https://github.com/allenai/papermage\n5 Hypothes.is: https://web.hypothes.ishttps://web.hypothes.is",

      "text": "en the content is important. For instance, our systems\ncould design pathways that, while they may be more efficient, do\nnot obfuscate the full context (e.g., Scim §3.1), and that encourage\ngood practices such as verification and provenance tracing. A final\nconsideration is around what is ethical reuse of a paper’s contents\nto support reader experiences outside of that paper and its licensing\nimplications. For instance, CiteRead (§2.2) extracts paper citances\nand places them in the cited paper, and Relatedly (§5.2) extracts\nrelated work sections from different papers for users to explore.\nRecent trends in open science and datasets [ 29 , 61 , 67 , 68 ] point to\na promising future where we could continue to explore different\nways to remix and reuse scholarly content across context so that\nfuture scientists can take fuller advantage of prior research.\n8\nCONCLUSION",
