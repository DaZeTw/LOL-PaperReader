As shown in Table 14 , the results indicate that train- ing on feedback data only slightly improves consis- tency. On the other hand, we find that the LMs with a large number of parameters achieve high consis- tency. This indicates the importance of selecting a large LM as the base model when training an evalu- ator LM. Notably, P ROMETHEUS -2-8 X 7B obtains the highest correlation among open evaluator LMs. Moreover, to evaluate consistency in pairwise ranking settings (Table 15 ), we measure transitivity ( i.e. , a higher score for response B over A, and for C over B, results in a higher score for C over A). As shown in Table 15 , the P ROMETHEUS 2",
