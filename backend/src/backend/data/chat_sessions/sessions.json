        "content": "The main finding of the research is the introduction of the Transformer model, which is the first sequence transduction model that relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrent or convolutional layers. This model demonstrates superior performance in machine translation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art BLEU scores on both the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, while also being significantly faster to train compared to traditional architectures. Additionally, the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks, such as English constituency parsing, indicating its versatility and effectiveness across different applications [c1][c2][c3][c4][c5].",

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU.
