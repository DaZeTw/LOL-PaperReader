This randomness can come from various sources, such as unpredictable external influences, inherent variability in the system's components, or uncertainty in the system's parameters.  Because of this randomness, the system's future state cannot be perfectly predicted, and its behavior can only be described in terms of probabilities.  This means that instead of having a fixed, deterministic response, stochastic systems exhibit a range of possible outcomes, each with its own likelihood."
